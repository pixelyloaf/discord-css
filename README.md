this includes css for discord
idk i use most of these

all of these are mostly gonna be in the vencord server you can join that [here](https://discord.gg/4Ds9QfGn87) i dont know if github supports this but im keeping it

if anybody that owns these wants me to remove it contact me on discord (loaf0002) or github issue most likely already share a server though so you can ignore the friend request
# Install guide
## Vencord
work in progress

## BetterDiscord

## Import/QuickCSS
i could do this right now but i'll wait until i finish the others

# Stylish support?
i have tried getting it working, except the servers seem to be gone and the titlebar is still there

if anyone knows how to fix i'd be happy to accept it (please i barely know what im doing)

tldr; broken, wont work on it but pull requests accepted
