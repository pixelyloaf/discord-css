this includes css for discord
idk i use most of these

all of these are mostly gonna be in the vencord server you can join that [here](https://discord.gg/4Ds9QfGn87) i dont know if github supports this but im keeping it

if anybody that owns these wants me to remove it contact me on discord (loaf0002) or github issue most likely already share a server though so you can ignore the friend request
